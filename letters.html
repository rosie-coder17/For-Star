        My dearest, I have been thinking about you endlessly… I am writing this
        because I would like to just show the appreciation that I have for you.
        I have been thinking of how I could make the day special given I am this
        far from you. I know that the easiest I could have done would be have
        been to ask you, which I will now. But I just want you to know that I
        like you a lot and continue to find a reason to each day.<br /><br />
        I feel the need to keep coming around and learning to be a better
        person. This is because of the way you embody patience annd express
        love. Also they way you held my hand, let alone when you cook to
        encourage me sometimes, lol🤍🥹. Just the thought of putting yourself
        aside each time makes me melt inside. Every moment with you felt and
        feels like magic.I look forward to having many more moments with you. I
        am ready to grow with you in the best ways possible ways while still
        keeping the same rhythm that we still have. Finding each other on days
        when we loose the rhythm of our feet.
